# Introduction

At Hivello, we are unlocking a new way for people to take part in web3 projects and earn passive income - no blockchain experience necessary.

Our technology enables users to install an app on their physical devices like computers, routers, modems and storage nodes; by contributing resources they can start mining DePIN (Decentralised Physical Infrastructure Networks) protocols for Web3 applications without any specialized technical knowledge.

We're motivated by our mission: to make DePIN easily accessible worldwide so everyone can benefit from its power. By doing this, our vision is to create a more secure ecosystem where anyone can own their data safely over decentralized networks with peace of mind knowing it's protected against any centralised interference or malicious entities.

# Livepeer -  Supported GPUs

**Livepeer currently supports only Nvidia GPUs capable of both decoding and encoding.**

Please refer to [Video Encode and Decode GPU Support Matrix](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new) to check if your Nvidia GPU model supports both NVENC (hardware video encoder) and NVDEC (hardware video decoder).

For your convenience, here's a list of GPUs that have been tested and are known to be supported by Livepeer.
